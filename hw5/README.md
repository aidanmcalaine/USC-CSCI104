For this problem, I created one file called bayes, where I wrote all of my code. I used four main data structures to hold the data from train.txt and classify.txt that I would need to calculate the necessary probabilities (these data structures are located at the top of my main function). Apart from main, I wrote one other function called calculator, which did all of the calculations on the data. I then called this function towards the end of my main function, and wrote the output to the output file output.txt.
