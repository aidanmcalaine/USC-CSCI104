In this programming assignment, I worked to create two different programs. The first was called split, and it recrusively split an array of integers into two different arrays based on whether the numbers were even or odd. The second prograsm, ULList, allowed for the implementation of an unrolled link list, where each node had an array of size 10. I also implemented a number of functions that allowed me to add and remove numbers from the arrays with push_front, push_back, pop_front, and pop_back. I also wrote back, front, and getvalatloc, which returned an address to the back index, front index, and got the value at a specific index, respectively. 

I later wrote a supplemental print function to help with my test file, which I wrote to demonstrate every possible case of the operations on the unrolled link lists. 

Right before I finished implementing my code, I began to experience some issues with my terminal. It appeared to print one freeze frame from a past execution, and would not update when I wrote more code, even when I wrote a simple line with cout on the first line of the main function. For this reason, I had to continue implementing my test file AS IF my code was working and I could see it in the terminal. Of course, I am confident that it works, but there could be a chance that it doesn't for this reason.
