Problem 1: 

In this problem, I wrote a program that would 4 color a sample map with recursion and backtracing. In order to do so, I read in text file input, and then created an adjacency list in main. To recurse through the list and color it, I implemented a function called color, which called another function, isValid, inside it. 

Problem 2: 

In this problem, I implemented the functions for a d-ary MinHeap. The functions I implemented included a constructor, destructor, add, remove, peek, isEmpty, and size. I also wrote two helper functions, trickleUp and trickleDown, to assist me with the implementation of the operations.
