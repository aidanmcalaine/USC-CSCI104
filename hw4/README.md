Problem 1: 

For this problem, I completed the bst.h file by implementing a number of functions to allow for operations on a bst. This included insert, remove, clear, internalFind, getSmallestNode, isBalanced, and a number of helper functions as well as the constructor and destructor. While difficult and time consuming, I found this problem to be straightforward once I actually put enough time in. 


Problem 2: 

For this problem, I completed the insert and remove functions for the avlbst, as well as a number of helper functions used for rotations and updating the height of individual nodes in the tree. I found this problem to be more difficult than bst, but was able to incorporate some of my code from inserting and removing in the bst. 

Problem 3: 

I found this problem to be the most difficult of the problem set. For this problem, I implemented a recursive function that would find a layout of rectanglar pieces in a NxM grid of booleans. I also wrote an overlap helper function that would ensure that I was placing a given rectangle in a valid location on the grid. After the program was functional with an std::map, I changed it to use my AVLTree implementation instead.
